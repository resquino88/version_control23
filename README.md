#### **_Description_** <br>
A program to remove a letter from an input name.

#### **_How It Works_** <br>
Our code asks the user to input their name, which is then used to remove letters out of. After inputing
their name, the user is asked to input a letter to remove. If the letter entered is not an alphabetical character or
the length is not 1, we raise an exception and ask the user to enter a valid character. If the character entered is valid,
the name with the removed character is printed.
